- MASQUE over HTTP/3, WireGuard, WARP-on-WARP, Psiphon, and Tor
- Device-wide TCP, UDP, and QUIC support
- Exit-country selection, chained modes, and per-app split tunneling
- Quick Settings tile for instant connect and disconnect
- Fully refreshed Kourosh-AE dark and light themes
- Reproducible APK builds through GitHub Actions

## Download an APK

Open **Actions → Kourosh-AE Android Build → Artifacts** and download `Kourosh-AE-debug-apks`. The workflow builds installable Debug APKs for arm64, armv7, and x86_64 without requiring a private signing key.

## Build locally

Requirements: JDK 17, Android SDK 36, NDK `26.3.11579264`, CMake `3.22.1`, and stable Rust.

```bash
rustup target add aarch64-linux-android armv7-linux-androideabi x86_64-linux-android
cargo install cargo-ndk

```

The APKs are written to `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/`.
